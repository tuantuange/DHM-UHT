#DHM-UHT
This is a minimalist implementation of DHM-UHT ( removing all details that affect readability such as verbose, checkpoint, etc.). This version implements Unsupervised few-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset.

python main.py --algo=MAML --clustering=DBSCAN

Optional parameters are MAML/ANIL, DBSCAN/Kmeans

The full code and scripts will be released after the paper is accepted. Thank you for your understanding.
